These files are a handful of customizations that I find useful for the janus set of vim plugins.

Also included are some extra configurations for screen and a setup script to install them and save some typing.

Installation requires an install of janus already completed on the machine.

Downloading the monaco font-set for linux is also a prerequisite.

Once those are done, simply run the script to remap the user settings to the ones pulled from git.
